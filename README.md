# Intermediate Java Repo

## Change Log

- July 8/22 - Added the security slide and corrected slide for MT-1

## Instructor Notes

1. The JPA and MVC labs are fairly basic. All of the code the students need to write is in the Src directory.  
2. I ensured that Maven and Kafka are installed and working in the student VMs so that the Kafka and Spring labs could be done
3. There is no Java Kafka labs, it turned out to be too time consuming and too detailed for this class.
